# CNN Image Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the work for my thesis on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification. The project is structured to demonstrate the entire process from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Repository Structure
- `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook containing all the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset before feeding it into the CNN.
- `Image_Loading.ipynb`: Notebook that demonstrates how images are loaded and prepared for processing.
- `Modeling.ipynb`: This notebook includes the construction and training of the CNN model.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you need to install the required Python packages. You can install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
